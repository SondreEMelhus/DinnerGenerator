# Project plan

## Project description

Very basic random message generator program. Every time a user runs the program, they get a new, randomized output. To make the program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data.

### My idea

As I am a passionate home-cook I have decided to create a random dinner generator. Each time a user runs the program they will recive a new randomy generated dinner.
